# Notes on Time Series 

## Concepts

- Temporal Aggregation 
- Stationarity 
- Autocorrelation
- Seasonality 
- Trend 
- White Noise (No clear pattern)
- Smoothing Techniques
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
    (AutoRegression, Differencing and Moving Averages)
- Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL)
    (Seasonality, Trend and Remainder)
- Cross Correlation (Similarity measure)
- Granger Causality (Casual Relationships)

## Evaluation Metrics for ML

### Regression Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### Classification Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall (TPR (True Positive Rate) or Sensitivity)- F1 Score
- Area under Receiving Operating Characteristics (AU- ROC)
- Area under the Precision Recall Curve (AUC-PR)

### Clustering Metrics

- Silhouette Score (Similarity of object to Cluster)
- Davies - Boulding Index (Separation b/w clusters)
- Adjusted Rand Index (ARI- Similarity b/w True and Predicted Clusters)

### Time Series Forecasting Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Symmetric MAPE 

### NLP Metrics

- Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) (Overlap measure)
- Recall Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUE) (Quality Measure) 
- Perplexity (Probability distribution predicts a sample)

### Ranking Metrics

- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) (Effectiveness of retrieving documents based on Rank)
- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) (Ranking based on relevance scores)

### Anomaly Detection Metrics

- Precision at k (True anomalies among top k pred)
- Recall at k  (True anomalies found in top k)
